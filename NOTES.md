Project: Noble Dynasty(Working Title)
1. The Core Concept
Players lead a Noble Family through multiple generations. The game is defined by a "Sawtooth" power curve: you build your influence and workforce to a peak during a Family Head’s life, then experience a "crash" and "reset" upon their death. Success is measured in Victory Points (VP), earned through both active political maneuvers and the passive "Legacy" left behind by previous generations.

2. The Resource Ecosystem
Land (The Grid): A 3x5 grid where you build your estate.

The Wing Mechanic: You can mortgage the two 1x3 side wings for immediate Gold, but you lose the building slots until you buy them back.

Workers (The Household): Your action economy. You start a generation with a base (e.g., 5) and gain +2 workers every round as the family’s power grows.

Gold: Used for construction (Wood/Stone), hiring Henchmen, and training.

Influence: Political currency. Generated by estate buildings; used to trigger VP scoring and disrupt opponents.

Buildings: Infrastructure on your grid. They provide Housing (max worker cap) or produce Gold/Influence.

Henchmen: "Visitor" style cards that provide powerful one-time or lingering effects.

3. The Two Worlds
The Shared Capital (The Map): A Viticulture-style worker placement board with limited slots. This is where you compete for resources, buy buildings, and perform "High Politics" (Disruption).

The Personal Estate: Your private 3x5 grid. This is your engine. Actions here are safe from blocking but depend on what you have built and your available housing.

4. The Generational Cycle
A "Generation" lasts 4 rounds.

Growth: Each round, your worker pool increases. You build "Wide" (more housing/workers) or "Tall" (high-efficiency upgrades).

Succession (The Reset): At the end of 4 rounds, the Family Head dies.

Enshrinement: One building on your estate "flips" to its Legacy side. It stops producing resources but starts producing Passive VP every round.

Ghost Town: These Legacy buildings stay on your grid, permanently occupying space.

The Purge: Workers reset to the base level. Henchmen move to the "Fringe."

The Power Vacuum: The first round of a new Head is a period of vulnerability where your Legacy is easier for opponents to disrupt.

5. Conflict & Disruption
Active Disruption: Spending Influence to "Occupy" or block an opponent's active buildings/workers. Harder and more expensive.

Legacy Disruption (Slander): Attacking the "Passive VP" of a previous generation. Easier to do, but it only hurts the opponent's score, not their current turn.

Lingering Henchmen: Henchmen stay on the board after a Head dies but can be "Purged" or "Assassinated" by rivals during the transition.

6. Strategic Archetypes
The Landed Gentry (Wide): Keeps the full 3x5 grid, focuses on housing and a massive worker pool to dominate the Capital board.

The Ambitious Upstart (Tall): Mortgages wings early for cash, builds a few highly efficient Tier 3 buildings on a small footprint.

Next Steps for our Discussion:
The Henchmen Deck: Defining the specific "Types" (Spies, Merchants, Clergy) and their unique lingering effects.

Conversion Rates: Setting the specific math (e.g., How much Gold for a Palace? How much Influence for 10 VP?).

The "Death" Trigger: Finalizing if the change of Head is always at Round 4, or if players can force it earlier.

Would you like to dive into the Henchmen types when we continue, or should we start balancing the building costs?
