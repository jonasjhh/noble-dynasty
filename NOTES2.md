Project: Noble Dynasty (Updated Concept)
1. The Core Loop: Reigns & Successions
The game is played over a series of Reigns. A "Head" of the family has a natural lifespan (e.g., 4 rounds), but this can be cut short by Assassination.

The Sawtooth: Each round the Head survives, the household gains +2 Workers (momentum).

The Succession: When a Head dies or is killed, the family resets. The worker pool crashes back to the Housing Base, and Political Power is halved (50% carries over, 50% converts to VP).

2. Phase 1: The Political Vacuum (Mayor & Policy)
If there is no Mayor (due to death or the start of the game), an Election is held.

Bidding: Players spend Political Power to win the seat.

The Reign's Law: The Mayor enacts a Policy that remains active for as long as that Mayor is alive. This defines the "Era" (e.g., Taxation, Subsidies, or Martial Law).

The Target: Holding a Policy makes the Mayor a target for assassination, as killing them is the only way to end an oppressive Law early.

3. Phase 2: Action Placement (The Alternating Struggle)
Players take turns placing one worker at a time in one of two zones:

The Capital (Shared Map): Limited slots where players fight for resources (Gold, Power, Stone). This is also where you visit the Thieves Guild to commit to an assassination attempt.

The Estate (Personal 3x5 Grid): Private slots where players spend resources to build or activate specialized engines.

The Choice: Do you use your workers to grab gold from the Capital, or stay home to consolidate that gold into Victory Points?

4. Phase 3: Resolution & The Harvest
After all workers are placed:

Assassinations: Attempts are revealed. A successful hit ends a Reign, wipes the Policy, and forces an immediate Succession.

The Harvest: Players receive Income (Gold and Political Power) and Growth (+2 Workers if the Head survived).

5. Phase 4: The Legacy Transition
Only triggers upon the death of a Head.

The Legacy Worker: One worker from the deceased Head’s pool is placed permanently on an Estate building. This worker "guards the legacy," providing Passive VP every round but permanently shrinking the player's maximum worker capacity for the rest of the game.

The 50/50 Split: Half of the accumulated Political Power is cashed out for VP; the rest is inherited by the new Heir.

6. The Wealth Dilemma: Gold vs. Glory
Gold is the primary bridge between Reigns, but it is also the primary way to win.

The Endowment: Players must decide whether to spend Gold on Buildings (to make more money later) or "Deposit" it at the Cathedral to turn it into VP.

Liquidity Risk: Hoarding gold makes you a target; spending it on VP makes you "Prestigious" but leaves your next Heir poor and unable to defend the family.

Key Discussion Points for Later:
Assassination Math: Is it a fixed cost or a blind bid of Influence vs. Gold?

The Estate Buildings: What specific "Tier 3" buildings allow for the best Gold-to-VP conversion?

The "Slander" Mechanic: How exactly do players remove "Legacy Workers" to temporarily stop an opponent's passive scoring?

Would you like me to focus on the "Slander" mechanic next, or should we define the specific "Policies" a Mayor can enact?
